### Hi there 👋

I'm Ines, a NYC-based Data Analyst, proficient in Python, R, and SQL.

- 🔭 I’m currently trying to complete the 2021 edition of Advent of Code in real time!
- 🌱 I’m continously trying to improve my Python, R, Data Science and ML skills.
- 👯 I’d love to collaborate on cool short-term projects or participate in a Hackathon.
- 💬 Ask me about my Master's thesis or any of the projects I have up on Github!
