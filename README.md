### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ines, a NYC-based Data Analyst, proficient in Python, R, and SQL.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently practising solving [Leetcode](https://github.com/IAjimi/Leetcode) problems and reading *Fluent Python*.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m continously trying to improve my Python, R, Data Science and ML skills.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™d love to collaborate on cool short-term projects or participate in a Hackathon.
